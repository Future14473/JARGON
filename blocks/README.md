# Blocks

This was a fun experiment to try and create
control systems based off of literal block diagrams.

Like, you literally have "blocks", and you literally
connect inputs and outputs, and it runs.

Except there's a appreciable overhead of moving values around and recursion
and everything.

Except that when you want to do anything like add one
to a integer value it is a big hassle. And adding another
variable is really hard.

Think like programming scratch using not scratch. It's annoying.

So thats why this will no longer be supported. The current
system works; and it is well tested; but will not be developed on in the
future. Only bug fixes from now on.

This will be replaced by more granular elements that gives the user
more finer control of elements, plus a separate "specialized" module
that gives specialized common use cases that can be used directly
or as a template.
